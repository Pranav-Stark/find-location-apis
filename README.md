# find-location-apis.

Java project is developed using Spring-boot.

In this , there are five APIs in total to find desired result as follows.
1. Get Auto Completed Locations
2. Get Location (Passing text)
3. Get Near By Locations
4. Get Filtered Location On Category
5. Get Explored (Detailed) Location

To achive this , I am using third party APIs like Google and Foursquare.

Project includes following additional points as well.

1. Swagger implementation. (For better documentation)
2. Controller - Service layer architecture.
3. RestTemplate to make API calls
4. Test-cases driven. (Using JUnit and Mockito)
5. Logger
